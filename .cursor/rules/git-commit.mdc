# Git Commit Rules

- NEVER add `Co-authored-by` trailers to commits. Do not include `Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>` or any similar co-author line.
- When creating commits, use `git commit-tree` to bypass any automatic trailer injection if needed.
- Start every commit message with an emoji that reflects the change type (e.g. 🏗️ infra, 🐛 fix, 📚 docs, 🚀 feature).
- Keep commit messages concise — one short sentence describing the change.
