> A practical e-commerce platform with spring frameworks, kubernetes and deployed on AWS. The repository demonstrates microservice patterns and cloud-native capabilities with focus on scalability, security, resiliency, observability and deployment improvements.

💡 This application is not business oriented and my focus is mostly on technical part, I just want to implement a sample app from scratch with microservice architecture using different technologies, principles and patterns.

🌀 This Application is `in-progress` and I will add new features over time. 🌀
